<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p><span class="hide">T</span>he heir of Applebite continued to
squall and thrive, to the infinite delight of his youthful mamma,
who was determined that the joyful occasion of his cutting his
first tooth should be duly celebrated by an evening party of great
splendour; and accordingly cards were issued to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="cen">MR. AND MRS. APPLEBITE</p>
<p class="cen">REQUEST THE HONOUR OF</p>
<p class="cen">&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s</p>
<p class="cen">COMPANY TO AN EVENING PARTY,</p>
<p class="cen">On Thursday, the 12th inst.</p>
<p class="cen">
<em>Quadrilles</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>An
Answer will oblige</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>It was the first home-made party that Collumpsion had ever
given; for though during his bachelorhood he had been no niggard of
his hospitality, yet the confectioner had supplied the edibles, and
the upholsterer arranged the decorations; but now Mrs. Applebite,
with a laudable spirit of economy, converted No. 24,
Pleasant-terrace, into a perfect <em>cuisine</em> for a week
preceding the eventful evening; and old John was kept in a constant
state of excitement by Mrs. Waddledot, who superintended the
ornamental department of these elaborate preparations.</p>
<p>Agamemnon felt that he was a cipher in the house, for no one
condescended to notice him for three whole days, and it was with
extreme difficulty that he could procure the means of
&ldquo;recruiting exhausted nature&rdquo; at those particular hours
which had hitherto been devoted to the necessary operation.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 12th, Agamemnon was anxiously engaged in
endeavouring to acquire a knowledge of the last alterations in the
figure of <em>La Pastorale</em>, when he fancied he heard an
unusual commotion in the lower apartments of his establishment. In
a few moments his name was vociferously pronounced by Mrs.
Applebite, and the affrighted Collumpsion rushed down stairs,
expecting to find himself another Thyestes, whose children, it is
recorded, were made into a pie for his own consumption.</p>
<p>On entering the kitchen he perceived the cause of the uproar,
although he could see nothing else, for the dense suffocating
vapour with which the room was filled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; said Mrs. Applebite, &ldquo;the
chimney&rsquo;s on fire; one pound of fresh
butter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And two pound o&rsquo;lard&rsquo;s done it!&rdquo;
exclaimed Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; inquired Collumpsion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send for my brother, sir,&rdquo; said Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo; cried old John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On No. 746,&rdquo; replied Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried the whole assembled
party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s a hackney-coach as he
drives,&rdquo; said Betty.</p>
<p>A general chorus of &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; greeted this very
unsatisfactory rejoinder. Another rush of smoke into the kitchen
rendered some more active measures necessary, and, after a short
discussion, it was decided that John and Betty should proceed to
the roof of the house with two pailsful of water, whilst Agamemnon
remained below to watch the effects of the measure. When John and
Betty arrived at the chimney-pots, the pother was so confusing,
that they were undecided which was the rebellious flue! but, in
order to render assurance doubly sure, they each selected the one
they conceived to be the delinquent, and discharged the contents of
their buckets accordingly, without any apparent diminution of the
intestine war which was raging in the chimney. A fresh supply from
a cistern on the roof, similarly applied, produced no better
effects, and Agamemnon, in an agony of doubt, rushed up-stairs to
ascertain the cause of non-abatement. Accidentally popping his head
into the drawing-room, what was his horror at beholding the
beautiful Brussels carpet, so lately &ldquo;redolent of brilliant
hues,&rdquo; one sheet of inky liquid, into which Mrs. Waddledot
(who had followed him) instantly swooned. Agamemnon, in his alarm,
never thought of his wife&rsquo;s mother, but had rushed half-way
up the next flight of stairs, when a violent knocking arrested his
ascent, and, with the fear of the whole fire-brigade before his
eyes, he re-rushed to open the door, the knocker of which kept up
an incessant clamour both in and out of the house. The first person
that met his view was a footman, 25, dyed with the same sooty
evidence of John and Betty&rsquo;s exertions, as he had encountered
on entering his own drawing-room. The dreadful fact flashed upon
Collumpsion&rsquo;s mind, and long before the winded and saturated
servant could detail the horrors he had witnessed in &ldquo;his
missuses best bed-room, in No. 25,&rdquo; the bewildered proprietor
of No. 24 was franticly shaking his innocently offending menials on
the leads of his own establishment. Then came a confused noise of
little voices in the street, shouting and hurraing in the fulness
of that delight which we regret to say is too frequently felt by
the world at large at the misfortunes of one in particular. Then
came the sullen rumble of the parish engine, followed by violent
assaults on the bell and knocker, then another huzza! welcoming the
extraction of the fire-plug, and the sparkling fountain of
&ldquo;New River,&rdquo; which followed as a providential
consequence. Collumpsion again descended, as John had at last
discovered the right chimney, and having inundated the stewpans and
the kitchen, had succeeded in extinguishing the sooty cause of all
these disasters. The mob had, by this time, increased to an
alarming extent. Policemen were busily employed in making a ring
for the exhibition of the water-works&mdash;little boys were
pushing each other into the flowing gutters&mdash;small girls, with
astonished infants in their arms, were struggling for front places
against the opposite railings; and every window, from the
drawing-rooms to the attics, in Pleasant-terrace were studded with
heads, in someway resembling the doll heads in a gingerbread
lottery, with which a man on a wooden leg was tempting the monied
portion of the juvenile alarmists. Agamemnon opened the door, and
being flanked by the whole of his household, proceeded to address
the populace on the present satisfactory state of his kitchen
chimney. The announcement was received by expressions of extreme
disgust, as though every auditor considered that a fire ought to
have taken place, and that they had been defrauded of their time
and excitement, and that the extinguishing of the same by any other
means than by legitimate engines was a gross imposition. He was
about remonstrating with them on the extreme inconvenience which
would have attended a compliance with their reasonable and humane
objections, when his eloquence was suddenly cut short by a <em>jet
d&rsquo;eau</em> which a ragged urchin directed over him, by
scientifically placing his foot over the spouting plug-hole. This
clever manoeuvre in some way pacified the crowd, and after awaiting
the re-appearance of the parish engineer, who had insisted on a
personal inspection of the premises, they gave another shout of
derision and departed.</p>
<p>Thus commenced the festivities to celebrate the advent of the
first tooth of the Heir of Applebite.</p>
<hr />
<h3>GRAVESEND.</h3>
<h4>(<em>From our own Correspondent</em>.)</h4>
<p>This delightful watering-place is filled with beauty and
fashion, there being lots of large curls and small bonnets in every
portion of the town and neighbourhood.</p>
<p>We understand it is in contemplation to convert the mud on the
banks of the river into sand, in order that the idea of the
sea-side may be realised as far as possible. Two donkey cart-loads
have already been laid down by way of experiment, and the spot on
which they were thrown was literally thronged with pedestrians. The
only difficulty likely to arise is, that the tide washes the sand
away, and leaves the mud just as usual.</p>
<p>The return of the imports and exports shows an immense increase
in the prosperity of this, if not salubrious sea-port, at least
healthy watercourse. It seems that the importation of Margate
slippers this year, as compared with that of the last, has been as
two-and-three-quarters to one-and-a-half, or rather more than
double, while the consumption of donkeys has been most gratifying,
and proves beyond doubt that the pedestrians and equestrians are
not so numerous by any means as the asinestrians. The first round
of a new ladder for ascending the balconies of the bathing-rooms
was laid on Wednesday, amidst an inconvenient concourse of
visitors. With the exception of a rap on the toes received by those
who pressed so much on the carpenter employed as to retard the
progress of his work, all passed off quietly. After the ceremony,
the man was regaled by the proprietor of the rooms with some beer,
at the tap of the neighbouring hotel for families and
gentlemen.</p>

<h2>TESTIMONIALS.</h2>
<h4>TO MR. PUNCH.</h4>
<p>SIR,&mdash;Having incautiously witnessed two consecutive
performances of Mr. Macready in the &ldquo;Lady of Lyons,&rdquo;
the comic portions of them threw me into a state of deep and
chronic melancholy, which the various physicians employed were
unable to cure. Hearing, however, of your excellent medicine, I
took it regularly every Saturday for five weeks, and am now able to
go about my daily employment, which being that of a low comedian,
was materially interfered with by my late complaint.</p>
<p class="cen">I remain, with gratitude, yours truly,</p>
<p class="rgt">JOHN SAUNDERS.</p>
<p><em>New Strand Theatre</em>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>SIR,&mdash;I was, till lately, private secretary to Lord John
Russell. I had to copy his somniferous dispatches, to endure a
rehearsal of his prosy speeches, to get up, at an immense labour to
myself, incessant laughs at his jokes. At length, by the enormous
exertions the last duty imposed upon me, I sunk into a hopeless
state of cachinnatory impotence: my risible muscles refused to
perform their office, and I lost mine. I was discharged.
Fortunately, however, for me, I happened to meet with your
infallible &ldquo;Pills to Purge Melancholy,&rdquo; and tried Nos.
1 to 10 inclusive of them.</p>
<p>With feelings overflowing with gratitude, I now inform you, that
I have procured another situation with Sir James Graham; and to
show you how completely my roaring powers have returned, I have
only to state, that it was I who got up the screeching applause
with which Sir James&rsquo;s recent jokes about the Wilde and Tame
serjeants were greeted.</p>
<p class="cen">I am, Sir, yours,</p>
<p class="rgt">GEORGE STEPHEN,</p>
<p>Late &ldquo;over&rdquo;-Secretary, and Author of the
&ldquo;Canadian Rebellion.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>SIR,&mdash;Being the proprietor of several weekly newspapers,
which I have conducted for many years, my jocular powers gradually
declined, from hard usage and incessant labour, till I was reduced
to a state of despair; for my papers ceasing to sell, I experienced
a complete stoppage of circulation.</p>
<p>In this terrible state I had the happiness to meet with your
&ldquo;Essence of Guffaw,&rdquo; and tried its effect upon my
readers, by inserting several doses of your Attic salt in my
&ldquo;New Weekly Messenger,&rdquo; &ldquo;Planet,&rdquo; &amp;c.
&amp;c. The effects were wonderful. Their amount of sale increased
at every joke, and has now completely recovered.</p>
<p class="cen">I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="rgt">JOHN BELL.</p>
<p><em>Craven-street, Strand</em>.</p>
<p><em>Note.</em>&mdash;This testimonial is gratifying, as the
gentleman has hitherto failed to acknowledge the source of the
wonderful cure we have effected in his property.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>SIR,&mdash;As the author of the facetious political essays in
the &ldquo;Morning Herald,&rdquo; it is but due to you that I
should candidly state the reason why my articles have, of late, so
visibly improved.</p>
<p>In truth, sir, I am wholly indebted to you. Feeling a gradual
debility come over my faceti&aelig;, I tried several potions of the
&ldquo;New Monthly&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bentley&rsquo;s
Miscellany,&rdquo; without experiencing the smallest relief.
&ldquo;PUNCH&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Essence of Guffaw&rdquo; were,
however, most strongly recommended to me by my friend the editor of
&ldquo;Cruikshank&rsquo;s Omnibus,&rdquo; who had wonderfully
revived after taking repeated doses. I followed his example, and am
now completely re-established in fine, jocular health.</p>
<p class="cen">I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="rgt">THE &ldquo;<em>OWN</em> CORRESPONDENT.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Shoe-lane</em>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Inestimable SIR,&mdash;A thousand blessings light upon your
head! You have snatched a too fond heart from a too early grave. My
life-preserver, my PUNCH! receive the grateful benedictions of a
resuscitated soul, of a saved Seraphina Simpkins!</p>
<p>Samuel, dearest PUNCH, was false! He took Jemima to the
Pavilion; I detected his perfidy, and determined to end my sorrows
under the fourth arch of Waterloo-bridge.</p>
<p>In my way to the fatal spot I passed&mdash;no, I could
<em>not</em> pass&mdash;your office. By chance directed, or by fate
constrained, I stopped to read a placard of your infallible
specific. I bought one dose&mdash;it was enough. I have now
forgotten Samuel, and am happy in the affection of another.</p>
<p>Publish this, if you please; it may be of service to young
persons who are crossed in love, and in want of straw-bonnets at
3s. 6d. each, best Dunstable.</p>
<p class="cen">I am, yours,</p>
<p class="rgt">SERAPHINA SIMPKINS,</p>
<p>Architect of Tuscan, straw, and other bonnets, Lant-street,
Borough.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>CAUTION.&mdash;None are genuine unless duly stamped&mdash;with
good humour, good taste, and good jokes. Observe: &ldquo;PUNCH, OR
THE LONDON CHARIVARI, price Threepence,&rdquo; is on the cover.
Several spurious imitations are abroad, at a reduced price, the
effects of which are dreadful upon the system.</p>

who can suffer the running of pins into their legs without

winking. A few respectable-looking men, to get up in the room and
make speeches on the subject of the mesmeric science, will also be
treated with. Quakers&rsquo; hats and coats are kept on the

<h3>MATINEE MESMERIQUE</h3>
<h4><em>Or, Proc&eacute;d&eacute; Humbugaresque.</em></h4>
<p>There is at present in London a gentleman with an enormous
beard, who professes the science of animal magnetism, and
undertakes to deprive of sense those who come under his hand; but
as those who flock to his exhibition have generally left all the
sense they possess at home, he finds it difficult to accomplish his
purposes. If it is animal magnetism to send another to sleep, what
a series of <em>Soir&eacute;es Mesm&eacute;riques</em> must take
place in the House of Commons during the sitting of Parliament!
There is no doubt that Sir Robert Peel is the Lafontaine of
political mesmerism&mdash;<em>the fountain</em> of
quackery&mdash;and every pass he makes with his hand over poor John
Bull serves to bring him into that state of stupefaction in which
he may be most easily victimised. While Lafontaine thrusts pins
into his patient, the Premier sends poor John into a swoon, for the
purpose of, as it is vulgarly termed, <em>sticking it into
him</em>; and as the French quack holds lucifers to the nostril,
Peel plays the devil under the very nose of the paralysed sufferer.
One resorts to <em>electrics</em>, the other to <em>election
tricks</em>, but each has the same object in view&mdash;to bring
the subject of the operation into a state of unconsciousness. If
the Premier would give a <em>Matin&eacute;e Politique</em>, it
would prove a formidable rival to the <em>Soir&eacute;e
Mesm&eacute;rique</em> of the gentleman in the beard, who seems
impressed with the now popular idea, that genius and a clean chin
are wholly incompatible.</p>
<hr />
<h3>(H)ALL IS LOST NOW!</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Sir B. HALL is still Sir B. Hall. Where is the
peerage&mdash;the &ldquo;B-all and end-all&rdquo; of his
patriotism? Really the Whigs ought to have given the poor dog a
bone, considering with what perseverance he has always been</p>

<p>STANDING FOR MARROWBONE (MARYLEBONE).</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>When a person holds an argument with his neighbour on the
opposite aide of the street, why is there no chance of their
agreeing?&mdash;Because they argue from different
<em>premises</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>NOVEL SUBSCRIPTIONS.</h3>
<p>Looking into an Australian paper the other day, we cast our eye
over a list of subscriptions for the &ldquo;St. Patrick&rsquo;s
Orphan School, Windsor;&rdquo; which, after enumerating several
sums, varying from 10<em>l.</em> to <em>five</em> shillings, ended
with the following singular contributions:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>MR. BURKE&mdash;A supply of potatoes.</li>
<li>A FRIEND&mdash;Five pounds of beef, and a coat.</li>
<li>A FRIEND IN NEED&mdash;A shoulder of mutton.</li>
<li>A POOR WOMAN&mdash;A large damper.</li>
<li>AN EMIGRANT&mdash;Ten quarts of milk.</li>
<li>AN EMIGRANT&mdash;A frying-pan.</li>
</ul>
<p>At first we were disposed to be amused with the heterogeneous

<h2>BERNARD CAVANAGH</h2>
<h3>AND THE POOR LAW COMMISSIONERS.</h3>
<p>It is not generally known that the above gentleman has been
officially engaged by the eminent and philanthropic pauper-patrons,
to put his principles into practice throughout the whole of the
Unions in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Knowing the extraordinary appetite of the vulgar for anything
approaching the unintelligible and marvellous, we feel sorry to be
obliged, by a brief detail of this gentleman&rsquo;s early life and
habits, to divest the present phenomenon of much of its apparent
wonder and romance.</p>
<p>Mr. Cavanagh was in infancy rather remarkable for the many
sleepless nights he occasioned his worthy parents by his juvenile
intimations that fasting at that time was no part of his system. He
progressed rapidly in his powers of consumption, and was indeed a
child of</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/011-07.png"><img src=
"images/011-07.png" alt="A portly matron in full regalia." id=
"img011-07" name="img011-07" width="50%" /></a>
<p>A FULL HABIT;</p>
</div>
<p>or, as his nurse expressed it, he was <em>alwaist</em> good for
three rounds at breakfast, not at all to be sneezed at luncheon,
anything but bad at dinner, hearty at tea (another three-rounder),
and very consistent at supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reverse of fortune changes friends&rdquo;&mdash;reverse
of circumstances, alas! too often changes feeds!&mdash;pecuniary
disappointments brought on a reduction of
circumstances&mdash;reduction of circumstances occasioned a
reduction of meals, and the necessity for such reduction being very
apparent to a philosophic mind, engendered a reduction of craving
for the same. Perhaps nothing could have proved more generally
beneficial than the individual misfortunes of Mr. Bernard Cavanagh,
which transferred him to one of those Elysiums of brick and mortar,
the &ldquo;Poor Law Union.&rdquo; Here, as he himself expresses it,
the fearful fallacies of his past system were made beautifully
apparent; he felt as if existence could be maintained by the
infinitesimal process, so benevolently advocated and regularly
prepared, that one step more was all that was necessary to arrive
at dietary perfectibility. That step he took, it being simply,
instead of next to nothing, to live on nothing at all; and now,
such was his opinion of the condiments supplied, he declares it to
be by far the pleasantest of the two.</p>
<p>It has been reported that Mr. Bernard Cavanagh&rsquo;s powers of
abstinence have their latent origin in enthusiasm. This he
confesses to be the case, his great admiration for fasting having
arisen from the circumstance of his frequently seeing the process
of manufacturing the pauper gruel, which sight filled him with most
intense yearnings to hit upon some plan by which, as far as he was
concerned, he might for ever avoid any participation in its
consumption.</p>
<p>That immense cigar, the mild Cavanagh! favours us with the
following practical account of his system; by which he intends,
through the means of enthusiasm, to render breakfasts a
superfluity&mdash;luncheons, inutilities&mdash;dinners, dreadful
extravagancies&mdash;teas, iniquitous wastes&mdash;and suppers,
supper-erogatories.</p>
<p>Mr. B.C. proposes the instant dismissal, without wages or
warning, of all the cooks, and substitution of the like number of
Ciceros; thereby affording a more ample mental diet, as the
followers will be served out with orations instead of rations. For
the proper excitement of the necessary enthusiasm, he submits the
following Mental Bill of Fare:&mdash;</p>

<li>Daniel O&rsquo;Connell&mdash;whose successful practice of the
exciting and fasting, or rather, starving system, among the rent
contributors in Ireland, not only proves the truth of the theory,
but enables B.C. to recommend him as the safest dish in the

credibly informed that the same enlightened gentleman is at present
making arrangements with Sir Robert Peel for the total repeal of
the use of bread by all operatives, and thereby tranquillising the
present state of excitement upon the corn-law question; proving
bread, once erroneously considered the staff of life, to be nothing
more than a mere ornamental opera cane.</p>

<h2>SYNCRETIC LITERATURE.</h2>
<p class="note"><em>Concluding remarks on an Epic Poem of Giles
Scroggins and Molly Brown.</em></p>
<p>The circumstance which rendered Giles Scroggins peculiarly
ineligible as a bridegroom eminently qualified him as a tenant for
one of those receptacles in which defunct mortals progress to
&ldquo;that bourne from whence no traveller returns.&rdquo; Fancy
the bereaved Molly, or, as she is in grief, and grief is tragical,
Mary Brown, denuded of her scarf and black gloves, turning faintly
from the untouched cake and tasteless wine, and retiring to the
virtuous couch, whereon, with aching heart, the poet asserts she,
the said</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Poor Molly, laid her down to weep;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and then contemplate her the victim of somnolent consequences,
when&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;She cried herself quite fast asleep,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here an ordinary mind might have left the maiden and reverted
&ldquo;to her streaming eyes,&rdquo; inflamed lids, dishevelled
locks, and bursting sigh, as satisfactory evidences of the truth of
her broken-heartedness, but the &ldquo;great anonymous&rdquo; of
whom we treat, scorns the application of such external
circumstances as agents whereby to depict the intenseness of the
passion of the ten thousand condensed turtle-doves glowing in the
bosom of <em>his</em> heroine. Sleep falls upon her eyes; but the
&ldquo;life of death,&rdquo; the subtle essence of the shrouded
soul, the watchful sentinel and viewless evidence of immortality,
the wild and flitting air-wrought impalpabilities of her fitful
dreams, still haunt her in her seeming hours of rest. Fancy her
feelings&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;When, standing fast by her bed-post,</p>
<p>A figure tall her sight engross&rsquo;d,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and it cried&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I be&rsquo;s Giles Scroggins&rsquo;
ghost.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Such is the frightful announcement commemorative of this
visitation from the wandering spirit of the erratic Giles. Death
has indeed parted them. Giles is cold, but still his love is warm!
He loved and won her in life&mdash;he hints at a right of
possession in death; and this very forgetfulness of what he
<em>was</em>, and what he <em>is</em>, is the best essence of the
overwhelming intensity of his passion. He continues (with a
beautiful reliance on the faith and <em>living</em> constancy of
Molly, in reciprocation, though dead, of his deathless attachment)
to offer her a share, not of his bed and board, but of his shell
and shroud. There is somewhat of the imperative in the invitation,
which runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;The ghost it said so solemnly,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Molly, you <em>must</em> go with me,</p>
<p>All to the grave, your love to cool.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We have no doubt this assumption of command on the part of the
ghost&mdash;an assumption, be it remembered, never ventured upon by
the living Giles&mdash;gave rise to some unpleasant reflections in
the mind of the slumbering Molly. <em>Must</em> is certainly an
awkward word. Tell any lady that she <em>must</em> do this, or
<em>must</em> do that, and, however much her wishes may have
previously prompted the proceeding, we feel perfectly satisfied,
that on the very shortest notice she will find an absolute and
undeniable reason why such a proceeding is diametrically opposed to
the line of conduct she <em>will</em>, and therefore ought to,
adopt.</p>
<p>With an intuitive knowledge of human nature, the great poet
purposely uses the above objectionable word. How could he do
otherwise, or how more effectually, and less offensively, extricate
Molly Brown from the unpleasant tenantry of the proposed
under-ground floor? Command invariably begets opposition,
opposition as certainly leads to argument. So proves our heroine,
who, with a beautiful evasiveness, delivers the following
expostulation:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Says she, &lsquo;I am not dead, you
fool!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>One would think <em>that</em> was a pretty decent clincher, by
way of a reason <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name=
"page125"></a>[pg 125]</span> for declining the proposed trip to
Giles Scroggins&rsquo; little property at his own peculiar
&ldquo;Gravesend;&rdquo; but as contradiction begets controversy,
and the enlightened poet is fully aware of the effect of that
cause, the undaunted sprite of the interred Giles instantly opposes
this, to him, flimsy excuse, and upon the peculiar veracity of a
wandering ghost, triumphantly exclaims, in the poet&rsquo;s
words&mdash;words that, lest any mistake should arise as to the
speaker by the peculiar construction of the sentence, are rendered
<em>doubly</em> individual, for&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;<em>Says</em> the <em>ghost</em>, says <em>he</em>, vy
that&rsquo;s no rule!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There&rsquo;s a staggerer! being alive no rule for <em>not</em>
being buried! how <em>is</em> Molly Brown to get out of that
high-pressure cleft-stick? how! that&rsquo;s the question! Why not
in a state of somnolency, not during the &ldquo;death of each
day&rsquo;s life; no, it is clear, to escape such a consummation
she must be wide awake.&rdquo; The poet sees this, and with the
energy of a master-mind, he brings the invisible chimera of her
entranced imagination into effective operation. Argument with a man
who denies first premises, and we submit the assertion that
vitality is no exception to the treatment of the dead, amounts to
that. We say, argument with such a man is worse than nothing; it
would be fallacious as the Eolian experiment of whistling the most
inspiriting jigs to an inanimate, and consequently unmusical,
milestone, opposing a transatlantic thunder-storm with &ldquo;a
more paper than powder&rdquo; &ldquo;penny cracker,&rdquo; or
setting an owl to outstare the meridian sun.</p>
<p>The poet knew and felt this, and therefore he ends the delusion
and controversy by an overt act:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;The ghost then seized her all so grim,</p>
<p>All for to go along with him;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;e&rsquo;er morning
beam.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To which she replies with the following determined
announcement:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I von&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said she, and scream&rsquo;d
a scream,</p>
<p>Then she voke, and found she&rsquo;d dream&rsquo;d a
dream!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These are the last words we have left to descant upon: they are
such as should be the last; and, like <em>Joseph Surface</em>,
&ldquo;moral to the end.&rdquo; The glowing passions the fervent
hopes, the anticipated future, of the loving pair, all, all are
frustrated! The great lesson of life imbues the elaborate
production; the thinking reader, led by its sublimity to a train of
deep reflection, sees at once the uncertainty of earthly projects,
and sighing owns the wholesome, though still painful truth, that
the brightest sun is ever the first cause of the darkest shadow;
and from childhood upwards, the blissful visions of our gayest
fancy&mdash;forced by the cry of stern reality&mdash;call back the
mental wanderer from imaginary bliss, to be again the worldly
drudge; and, thus awakened to his real state, confess, like our sad
heroine, Molly Brown, he too, has <em>dreamt a dream</em>.</p>

<h2>FATHER O&rsquo;FLYNN AND HIS CONGREGATION.</h2>
<p>Father Francis O&rsquo;Flynn, or, as he was generally called by
his parishioners, &ldquo;Father Frank,&rdquo; was the choicest
specimen you could desire of a jolly, quiet-going, ease-loving,
Irish country priest of the old school. His parish lay near a small
town in the eastern part of the county Cork, and for forty-five
years he lived amongst his flock, performing all the duties of his
office, and taking his dues (when he got them) with never-tiring
good-humour. But age, that spares not priest nor layman, had stolen
upon Father Frank, and he gradually relinquished to his younger
curates the task of preaching, till at length his sermons dwindled
down to two in the year&mdash;one at Christmas, and the other at
Easter, at which times his clerical dues were about coming in. It
was on one of these memorable occasions that I first chanced to
hear Father Frank address his congregation. I have him now before
my mind&rsquo;s eye, as he then appeared; a stout, middle-sized
man, with ample shoulders, enveloped in a coat of superfine black,
and substantial legs encased in long straight boots, reaching to
the knee. His forehead, and the upper part of his head, were bald;
but the use of hair-powder gave a fine effect to his massive, but
good-humoured features, that glowed with the rich tint of a hale
old age. A bunch of large gold seals, depending from a massive
jack-chain of the same metal, oscillated with becoming dignity from
the lower verge of his waistcoat, over the goodly prominence of his
&ldquo;fair round belly.&rdquo; Glancing his half-closed, but
piercing eye around his auditory, as if calculating the contents of
every pocket present, he commenced his address as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Well, my good people, I suppose ye know that
to-morrow will be the <em>pattern</em><sup>1</sup><span class=
"sidenote">1. <em>Pattern</em>&mdash;a corruption of
<em>Patron</em>&mdash;means, in Ireland, the anniversary of the
Saint to whom a holy well has been consecrated, on which day the
peasantry make pilgrimages to the well.<br />
2. Beads<br />
3. Pretty girl</span> of Saint Fineen, and no doubt ye&rsquo;ll all
be for going to the blessed well to say your
<em>padhereens</em>;<sup>2</sup> but I&rsquo;ll go bail
there&rsquo;s few of you ever heard the rason why the water of that
well won&rsquo;t raise a lather, or wash anything clean, though you
were to put all the soap in Cork into it. Well, pay attintiou, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you.&mdash;Mrs. Delany, can&rsquo;t you keep your
child quiet while I&rsquo;m spaking?&mdash;It happened a long while
ago, that Saint Fineen, a holy and devout Christian, lived all
alone, convaynient to the well; there he was to be found ever and
always praying and reading his breviary upon a cowld stone that lay
beside it. Onluckily enough, there lived also in the neighbourhood
a <em>callieen dhas</em><sup>3</sup> called Morieen, and this
Morieen had a fashion of coming down to the well every morning, at
sunrise, to wash her legs and feet; and, by all accounts, you
couldn&rsquo;t meet a whiter or shapelier pair from this to Bantry.
Saint Fineen, however, was so disthracted in his heavenly
meditations, poor man! that he never once looked at them; but kept
his eyes fast on his holy books, while Morieen was rubbing and
lathering away, till the legs used to look like two beautiful
pieces of alabasther in the clear water. Matters went on this way
for some time, Morieen coming regular to the well, till one fine
morning, as she stepped into the water, without minding what she
was about, she struck her foot against a a stone and cut it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! Millia murdher! What&rsquo;ll I do?&rsquo;
cried the <em>callieen</em>, in the pitifulles voice you ever
heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said Saint
Fineen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve cut my foot agin this misfortinat
stone,&rsquo; says she, making answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Saint Fineen lifted up his eyes from his blessed
book, and he saw Morieen&rsquo;s legs and feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! Morieen!&rsquo; says he, after looking awhile
at them, &lsquo;what white legs you have got!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have I?&rsquo; says she, laughing, &lsquo;and how
do <em>you</em> know that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately the Saint remimbered himself, and being full
of remorse and conthrition for his fault, he laid his commands upon
the well, that its water should never wash anything white
again.&mdash;and, as I mentioned before, all the soap in Ireland
wouldn&rsquo;t raise a lather on it since. Now that&rsquo;s the
thrue histhory of St. Fineen&rsquo;s blessed well; and I hope and
thrust it will be a saysonable and premonitory lesson to all the
young men that hears me, not to fall into the vaynial sin of
admiring the white legs of the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as his reverence paused, a buzz of admiration ran
through the chapel, accompanied by that peculiar rapid noise made
by the lower class of an Irish Roman Catholic congregation, when
their feelings of awe, astonishment, or piety, are excited by the
preacher.<sup>4</sup><span class="sidenote">4. This sound, which is
produced by a quick motion of the tongue against the teeth and roof
of the mouth, may be expressed thus; &ldquo;tth, tth, tth, tth,
tth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Father Frank having taken breath, and wiped his forehead,
resumed his address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to change my subject now, and I expect
attintion. Shawn Barry! Where&rsquo;s Shawn Barry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, your Rivirence,&rdquo; replies a voice from the
depth of the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up here, Shawn, &rsquo;till I examine you about your
Catechism and docthrines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rough-headed fellow elbowed his way slowly through the
congregation, and moulding his old hat into a thousand grotesque
shapes, between his huge palms, presented himself before his
pastor, with very much the air of a puzzled philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Shawn, my boy, do you know what is the meaning of
Faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parfictly, your Rivirence,&rdquo; replied the fellow,
with a knowing grin. &ldquo;Faith means when Paddy Hogan gives me
credit for half-a-pint of the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of my sight, you ondaycent vagabond; you&rsquo;re
a disgrace to my flock. Here, you Tom M&rsquo;Gawley, what&rsquo;s
Charity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bating a process-sarver, your Rivirence,&rdquo; replied
Tom, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! blessed saints! how I&rsquo;m persecuted with ye,
root and branch. Jim Houlaghan, I&rsquo;m looking at you, there,
behind Peggy Callanane&rsquo;s cloak; come up here, you hanging
<em>bone slieveen</em><sup>5</sup><span class="sidenote">5. A sly

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come to that yet, sir,&rdquo; replied Jim,
scratching his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t fear you, you bosthoon. Well, listen,
and I&rsquo;ll tell you. It&rsquo;s the day when you&rsquo;ll all
have to settle your accounts, and I&rsquo;m thinking there&rsquo;ll
be a heavy score against some of you, if you don&rsquo;t mind what
I&rsquo;m saying to you. When that day comes, I&rsquo;ll walk up to
Heaven and rap at the hall door. Then St. Pether, who will be
takin&rsquo; a nap after dinner in his arm-chair, inside, and not
liking ta be disturbed, will call out mighty surly,
&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s I, my Lord,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll make
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Av course, he&rsquo;ll know my voice, and, jumping up
like a cricket, he&rsquo;ll open the door as wide as the hinges
will let it, and say quite politely&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m proud to see you here, Father Frank.
Walk in, if you plase.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon that I&rsquo;ll scrape my feet, and walk in, and
then St. Pether will say agin&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Father Frank, what have you got to say for
yourself? Did you look well afther your flock; and mind to have
them all christened, and married, and buried, according to the
rites of our holy church?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, good people, I&rsquo;ve been forty-five years
amongst you, and didn&rsquo;t I christen every mother&rsquo;s soul
of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Congregation.</em>&mdash;You did,&mdash;you did,&mdash;your
Rivirence.</p>
<p><em>Father Frank.</em>&mdash;Well, and didn&rsquo;t I bury the

<p><em>Mick.</em>&mdash;You did, your Rivirence.</p>
<p><em>Father Frank.</em>&mdash;Well, that&rsquo;s

regularly?&rdquo; Ah! good Christians, how shall I answer
<em>that</em> question? Put it in my power to say something good of
you: don&rsquo;t be ashamed to come up and pay your priest&rsquo;s
dues. Come,&mdash;make a lane there, and let ye all come up with
conthrite hearts and open hands. Tim Delaney!&mdash;make way for
Tim:&mdash;how much will you give, Tim?</p>
<p><em>Tim.</em>&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not be worse than another, your
Riverence. I&rsquo;ll give a crown.</p>
<p><em>Father Frank.</em>&mdash;Thank you, Timothy: the dacent drop
is in you. Keep a lane, there!&mdash;any of ye that hasn&rsquo;t a
crown, or half-a-crown, don&rsquo;t be bashful of coming up with
your <em>hog</em> or your <em>testher</em>.<sup>6</sup><span class=
"sidenote">6. A <em>shilling</em> or a
<em>sixpence</em>.</span></p>
<p>And thus Father Frank went on encouraging and wheedling his
flock to pay up his dues, until he had gone through his entire
congregation, when I left the chapel, highly amused at the
characteristic scene I had witnessed.</p>

<h3>A PRUDENT REASON.</h3>
<p>Our gallant Sibthorp was lately invited by a friend to accompany
him in a pleasure trip in his yacht to Cowes. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
exclaimed Sib.; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t catch me venturing near
<em>Cowes</em>.&rdquo; &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; inquired his
friend. &ldquo;Because I was never vaccinated,&rdquo; replied the
hirsute hero.</p>

<h2>DOCTOR PEEL TAKING TIME TO CONSULT.</h2>
<p>Once upon a time&mdash;says an old Italian novelist&mdash;a
horse fell, as in a fit, with his rider. The people, running from
all sides, gathered about the steed, and many and opposite were the
opinions of the sudden malady of the animal; as many the
prescriptions tendered for his recovery. At length, a great hubbub
arose among the mob; and a fellow, with the brass of a merryandrew,
and the gravity of a quack-doctor, pressed through the throng, and
approached the beast. Suddenly there was silence. It was plain to
the vulgar that the solemn new-comer had brought with him some
exquisite specific: it was evident, from the grave self-complacency
of the stranger, that with a glance, he had detected the cause of
sickness in the horse,&mdash;and that, in a few seconds, the
prostrate animal, revivified by the cunning of the sage, would be
up, and once more curvetting and caracoling. The master of the
steed eyed the stranger with an affectionate anxiety; the mob were
awed into breathless expectation. The wise man shook his head, put
his cane to his nose, and proceeded to open his mouth. It was plain
he was about to speak. Every ear throbbed and gaped to catch the
golden syllables. At length the doctor did speak: for casting about
him a look of the profoundest knowledge, and pointing to the steed,
he said, in a deep, solemn whisper,&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Let the horse
alone!</em>&rdquo; Saying this, the doctor vanished!</p>
<p>The reader will immediately make the application. The horse
<em>John Bull</em> is prostrate. It will be remembered that Colonel
SIBTHORP (that dull mountebank) spoke learnedly upon
glanders&mdash;that others declared the animal needed a lighter
burthen and a greater allowance of corn,&mdash;but that the
majority of the mob made way for a certain quacksalver PEEL, who
being regularly called in and fee&rsquo;d for his advice, professed
himself to be possessed of some miraculous elixir for the suffering
quadruped. All eyes were upon the doctor&mdash;all ears open for
him, when lo! on the 16th of September,&mdash;PEEL, speaking with
the voice of an oracle, said&mdash;&ldquo;It is not my intention in
the present session of Parliament to submit any measures for the
consideration of the House!&rdquo; In other
words&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Let the horse alone!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The praises of the Tory mob are loud and long at this wisdom of
the doctor. He had loudly professed an intimate knowledge of the
ailments of the horse&mdash;he had long predicted the fall of the
poor beast,&mdash;and now, when the animal is down, and a remedy is
looked for that shall once more set the creature on his legs, the
veterinary politician says&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Let the horse
alone!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speech of Sir ROBERT PEEL was a pithy illustration of the
good old Tory creed. He opens his oration with a benevolent and
patriotic yearning for the comforts of Parliamentary warmth and
ventilation. He moves for papers connected with &ldquo;the building
of the two houses of Parliament, and with the adoption of measures
for <em>warming and ventilating</em> those houses!&rdquo; The whole
policy of the Tories has ever exemplified their love of nice warm
places; though, certainly, they have not been very great sticklers
for atmospheric purity. Indeed, like certain other labourers, who
work by night, they have toiled in the foulest air,&mdash;have
profited by the most noisome labour. When Lord JOHN RUSSELL
introduced that imperfect mode of ventilation, the Reform Bill,
into the house, had he provided for a full and pure supply of
public opinion,&mdash;had he ventilated the Commons by a more
extended franchise,&mdash;Sir ROBERT PEEL would not, as minister,
have shown such magnanimous concern for the creature comforts of
Members of Parliament&mdash;he might, indeed, have still displayed
his undying love of a warm place; but he would not have enjoyed it
on the bench of the Treasury. As for ventilation, why, the creature
Toryism, like a frog, could live in the heart of a tree;&mdash;it
being always provided that the tree should bear golden pippins.</p>
<p>We can, however, imagine that this solicitude of Sir ROBERT for
the ease and comfort of the legislative Magi may operate to his
advantage in the minds of certain honest folk, touched by the
humanity which sheds so sweet a light upon the opening oration of
the new minister. &ldquo;If&rdquo;&mdash;they will doubtless
think&mdash;&ldquo;the humane Baronet feels so acutely for the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal,&mdash;if he has this regard for the
convenience of only 658 knights and burgesses,&mdash;if, in his
enlarged humanity, he can feel for so helpless a creature as the
Earl of COVENTRY, so mild, so unassuming a prelate as the Bishop of
EXETER&mdash;if he can sympathise with the wants of even a
D&rsquo;ISRAELI, and tax his mighty intellect to make even SIBTHORP
comfortable,&mdash;surely the same minister will have, aye, a
morbid sense of the wants, the daily wretchedness of hundreds of
thousands, who, with the fiend Corn Law grinning at their fireless
hearths&mdash;pine and perish in weavers&rsquo; hovels, for the
which there has as yet been <em>no</em> &lsquo;adoption of measures
for the warming and ventilating.&rsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Surely&rdquo;&mdash;they will think&mdash;&ldquo;the man
whose sympathy is active for a few of the &lsquo;meanest things
that live&rsquo; will gush with sensibility towards a countless
multitude, fluttering into rags and gaunt with famine. He will go
back to first principles; he will, with a giant&rsquo;s arm, knock
down all the conventionalities built by the selfishness of
man&mdash;(and what a labourer is selfishness! there was no such
hard worker at the Pyramids or the wall of China)&mdash;between him
and his fellow! Hunger will be fed&mdash;nakedness will be
clothed&mdash;and God&rsquo;s image, though stricken with age, and
broken with disease, be acknowledged; not in the cut-and-dried
Pharisaical phrase of trading Church-goers, as a thing vested with
immortality&mdash;as a creature fashioned for everlasting
solemnities&mdash;but <em>practically</em> treated as of the great
family of man&mdash;a brother, invited with the noblest of the
C&aelig;sars, to an immortal banquet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such may be the hopes of a few, innocent of the knowledge of the
stony-heartedness of Toryism. For ourselves, we hope nothing from
Sir ROBERT PEEL. His flourish on the warming and ventilation of the
new Houses of Parliament, taken in connexion with his opinions on
the Corn Laws, reminds us of the benevolence of certain people in
the East, who, careless and ignorant of the claims of their
fellow-men, yet take every pains to erect comfortable hospitals and
temples for dogs and vermin. Old travellers speak of these places,
and of men being hired that the sacred fleas might feed upon their
blood. Now, when we consider the history of legislation&mdash;when
we look upon many of the statutes emanating from
Parliament&mdash;how often might we call the House of Commons the
House of Fleas? To be sure, there is yet this great difference: the
poor who give their blood there, unlike the wretches of the East,
give it for nothing!</p>
<p>Sir ROBERT&rsquo;S speech promises nothing whatever as to his
future policy. He leaves everything open. He will not say that he
will not go in precisely the line chalked out by the Whigs.
&ldquo;Next session,&rdquo; says. Sir ROBERT, &ldquo;you shall see
what you shall see.&rdquo; About next February, <em>Orson</em>, in
the words of the oracle in the melo-drama, will be &ldquo;endowed
with reason.&rdquo; Until then, we must accept a note-of-hand for
Sir ROBERT, that he may pay the expenses of the government.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have already expressed my opinion, that it is
absolutely necessary to adopt some measures for equalising the
revenue and expenditure, and we will avail ourselves of the
earliest opportunity, after mature consideration of the
circumstances of the country, to submit to a committee of the whole
house measures for remedying the existing state of things.
<em>Whether that can be best done by diminishing the expenditure of
the country, or by increasing the revenue, or by a combination of
those two means&mdash;the reduction of the expenditure and the
increase of the revenue&mdash;I must postpone for future
consideration.</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why, Sir ROBERT was called in because he knew the disease of the
patient. He had his remedy about him. The pills and the draught
were in his pocket&mdash;yes, in his patriotic poke; but he refused
to take the lid from the box&mdash;resolutely determined that the
cork should not be drawn from the all-healing phial&mdash;until he
was regularly called in; and, as the gypsies say, his hand crossed
with a bit of money. Well, he now swears with such vigour to the
excellence of his physic&mdash;he so talks for hours and hours upon
the virtues of his drugs, that at length a special messenger is
sent to him, and directions given that the Miraculous Doctor should
be received at the state entrance of the patient&rsquo;s castle,
with every mark of consideration. The Doctor is ensured his fee,
and he sets to work. Thousands and thousands of hearts are beating
whilst his eye scrutinizes John Bull&rsquo;s tongue&mdash;suspense
weighs upon the bosom of millions as the Doctor feels his pulse.
Well, these little ceremonies settled, the Doctor will, of course,
pull out his phial, display his boluses, and take his leave with a
promise of speedy health. By no means. &ldquo;I must go
home,&rdquo; says the Doctor, &ldquo;and study your disease for a
few months; cull simples by moonlight; and consult the whole
Materia Medica; after that I&rsquo;ll write you a prescription. For
the present, good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Doctor,&rdquo; cries the patient, &ldquo;I
dismissed my old physician, because you insisted that you knew my
complaint and its, remedy already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true,&rdquo; says Doctor PEEL,
&ldquo;but <em>then</em> I wasn&rsquo;t called in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The learned Bald&aelig;us tells us, that &ldquo;Ceylon doctors
give <em>jackall&rsquo;s flesh</em> for consumptions.&rdquo; Now,
consumption is evidently John Bull&rsquo;s malady; hence, we would
try the Ceylon prescription. The jackalls are the landowners; take
a little of <em>their flesh</em>, Sir ROBERT, and for once, spare
the bowels of the manufacturer.</p>

<h2>BUNKS&rsquo;S DISCOVERIES IN THE THAMES.</h2>
<p>A highly important and interesting survey of the coast between
Arundel-stairs and Hungerford-market pier, is now being executed,
under the superintendence of Bill Bunks, late commander of the
coal-barge &ldquo;Jim Crow.&rdquo; The result of his labours
hitherto have been of the most interesting nature to the natural
historian, the antiquarian, and the navigator. In his first report
to the magistrates of the Thames-police, he states that he has
advanced in his survey to Waterloo-bridge stairs, which he
describes as a good landing-place for wherries, funnies, and small
craft, but inadequate as a harbour for vessels of great burthen.
The shore from Arundel-street, as far as he has explored, consists
chiefly of a tenacious, dark-coloured substance, very closely
resembling thick mud, intermixed with loose shingles, pebbles, and
coal-slates. The depth of water is uncertain, as it varies with the
tide, which he ascertains rises and falls every six hours; the
greatest depth of water being usually found at the time when the
tide is full in, and <em>vice versa</em>. He has also made the
valuable discovery, that a considerable portion of the shore is
always left uncovered at low water, at which periods he availed
himself of the opportunity afforded him of examining it more
minutely, and of collecting a large number of curious specimens in
natural history, and interesting antiquarian relics. As we have had
the privilege of being permitted to view them in the private museum
of the
&ldquo;Stangate-and-Milbank-both-sides-of-the-water-united-for-the-advancement-
of-Science-Association,&rdquo; we are enabled to lay before our
readers the particulars of a few of these spoils, which the
perseverance and intrepidity of our gallant countryman, Bill Bunks,
has rescued from the hungry jaws of the rapacious deep;
viz.:&mdash;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;<em>A case of shells.</em>&rdquo; The greater number of
the specimens are pronounced, by competent judges, to be shells of
the native oyster; a fact worthy of note, as it proves the
existence, in former ages, of an oyster-bed on this spot, and
oysters being a sea-fish, it appears evident that either the sea
has removed from London, or London has withdrawn itself from the
sea. The point is open to discussion. We hope that the
&ldquo;Hookham-cum-Snivey Institution&rdquo; will undertake the
solution of it at one of their early meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The neck of a black bottle, with a cork in
it.</em>&rdquo; This is a very interesting object of art, and one
which has given rise to considerable discussion amongst the
<em>literati</em>. The cork, which is inserted in the fragment of
the neck, is quite perfect; it has been impressed with a seal in
reddish-coloured wax; a portion of it remains, with a partly
obliterated inscription, in Roman characters, of which we have been
enabled to give the accompanying fac-simile.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/011-09.png"><img src=
"images/011-09.png" alt=
"A partially obliterated seal, marked 'BR / PAT / BR'." id=
"img011-09" name="img011-09" width="30%" /></a></div>
<p>With considerable difficulty we have deciphered the legend
thus:&mdash;The first letter B has evidently been a mistake of the
engraver, who meant it for a P, the similarity of the sounds of the
two letters being very likely to lead him into such an error. With
this slight alteration, we have only to add the letter O to the
first line, and we shall have &ldquo;PRO.&rdquo; It requires little
acuteness to discover that the second word, if complete, would be
&ldquo;PATRIA;&rdquo; and the letters BR, the two lowest of the
inscription, only want the addition of the letters IT to make
&ldquo;BRIT.&rdquo; or &ldquo;BRITANNIARUM.&rdquo; The legend would
then run, &ldquo;PRO PATRIA BRITANNIARUM,&rdquo; which there is
good reason to suppose was the inscription on the cellar seal of
Alfred the Great, though some presumptuous and common-minded
persons have asserted that the legend, if perfect, would read,
&ldquo;BRETT&rsquo;S PATENT BRANDY.&rdquo; Every antiquarian has,
however, indignantly refused to admit such a degrading
supposition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;<em>A perfect brick, and two broken tiles.</em>&rdquo;
The first of these articles is in a high state of preservation, and
from the circumstance of portions of mortar being found adhering to
it, it is supposed that it formed part of the old London Wall. We
examined the fragments of the tiles carefully, but found no
inscription or other data, by which to ascertain their probable
antiquity: the tiles, in short, are buried in mystery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;<em>A fossil flat-iron.</em>&rdquo; This antediluvian
relic was found imbedded in a Sandy deposite opposite
Surrey-street, near high-water mark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;<em>An ancient leather buskin,</em>&rdquo; supposed to
have belonged to one of the Saxon kings. This singular covering for
the foot reaches no higher than the ancle, and is laced up the
front with a leathern thong, like a modern highlow, to which it
bears a very decided resemblance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;<em>A skeleton of some unknown animal.</em>&rdquo;
Antiquarians cannot agree to what genus this animal belonged;
ignorant people imagine it to have been a cat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;<em>A piece of broken porcelain.</em>&rdquo; This is an
undoubted relic of Roman manufacture, and appears to have formed
part of a plate. The blue &ldquo;willow pattern&rdquo; painted on
it shows the antiquity of that popular design.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several other extremely rare and curious antiquities
to be seen in this collection, which we have not space to notice at
present, but shall take an early opportunity of returning to the
valuable discoveries made by the indefatigable Mr. Bunks.</p>
<hr />
<h3>A NEW CONJURING COMPANY.</h3>
<p>A report of so extraordinary a nature has just reached us, that
we hasten to be the first, as usual, to lay the outlines of it
before our readers, with the same early authenticity that has
characterised all our other communications. Mr. Yates is at present
in Paris, arranging matters with Louis Philippe and his family, to
appear at the Adelphi during the ensuing season!!</p>
<p>It would appear that the mania for great people wishing to strut
and fret their four hours and a quarter upon the stage is on the
increase&mdash;at least according to our friends the constituent
members of the daily press. Despite the newspaper-death of the
manager of the Surrey, by which his enemies wished to
&ldquo;<em>spargere voces in vulgum ambiguas</em>&rdquo; to his
prejudice (which means, in plain English, to tell lies of him
behind his back), we have seen the report contradicted, that Mrs.
Norton was about to appear there in a new equestrian spectacle,
with double platforms, triple studs of Tartar hordes, and the other
amphitheatrical enticers. We ourselves can declare, that there is
no foundation in the announcement, no more than in the <em>on
dit</em> that the Countess of Blessington was engaged as a
counter-attraction, for a limited number of nights, at the
Victoria; or her lovely niece&mdash;a <em>power</em> in
herself&mdash;had been prevailed upon to make her
<em>d&eacute;but</em> at the Lyceum, in a new piece of a peculiar
and unprecedented plot, which was prevented from coming off by some
disagreement as to terms between the principal parties concerned.
For true theatrical intelligence, our columns alone are to be
relied upon; bright as a column of sparkling water, overpowering as
a column of English cavalry, overlooking all London at once, as the
column of the Monument, but <em>not</em> so heavy as the column of
the Duke of York.</p>
<p><em>Mais revenons &agrave; nos moutons</em>: which implies (we
are again compelled to translate, and this time it is for the
benefit of those who have not been to Boulogne), &ldquo;we spoke of
Louis Philippe and his family.&rdquo; This sagacious monarch,
foreseeing that the French were in want of some new excitement, and
grieving to find that the <em>pompe fun&egrave;bre</em> of
Napoleon, and the inauguration of his statue upon the monument of
the victories that never took place, had not made the intense
impression upon the minds of his vivacious subjects that he had
intended it should produce, begins to think, that before long a
fresh <em>&eacute;meute</em> will once more throw up the barricades
and paving-stones in the Rue St. Honor&eacute; and Boulevard des
Italiens. As such, with the prudent foresight which has hitherto
directed all his proceedings, he is naturally looking forward to
the best means of gaining an honest livelihood for himself and
family, should a corrupted national guard, or an excited St.
Antoine mob take it into their heads to dine in the Tuileries
without being asked. Having read in the English newspapers, which
he regularly peruses, of the astounding performances of the Wizard
of the North at the Adelphi, more especially as regards the
&ldquo;paralysing gun delusion,&rdquo; he commences to imagine that
he is well qualified to undertake the same responsibility, more
especially from the practice he has had in that line from pistols,
rifles, fowling-pieces, and, above all, twenty-barrel infernal
machines. He has therefore offered his services at the Adelphi, and
Mr. Yates, with his accustomed energy, and avowed propensity for
French translations, has agreed to bring him over. If we remember
truly, the Wizard says in his programme, that the secret shall die
with him. We beg to inform him, in all humility, that he deceives
himself, for Louis Philippe and the Duke d&rsquo;Aumale know the
trick as well as he does. They would ride through two lines of
<em>sans culottes</em>, all armed to the teeth, without the least
injury. They would catch the bullets in their teeth, and take them
home as curiosities.</p>
<p>Orleans, from his knowledge of the English language, will
probably become the adapter of the pieces &ldquo;from the
French&rdquo; about to be produced. The Duke de Nemours will be
engaged to play the fops in the light comedies, a line which, it is
anticipated, he will shine in; and the Prince de Joinville can
dance a capital sailor&rsquo;s hornpipe, which he learnt on board
the <em>Belle Poule</em>, a name which our own sailors, with an
excusable disregard for genders, converted into &ldquo;The Jolly
Cock.&rdquo; Of course, from his late experience, d&rsquo;Aumale
will assist Louis Philippe, upon emergency, in the gun trick, and,
with the other attractions, a profitable season is sure to
result.</p>
<hr />
<h3>AN EXTENSIVE SACRIFICE.</h3>
<p>By Dr. Reid&rsquo;s new plan for ventilating the House of
Commons, a porous hair carpet will be required for the floor; to
provide materials for which Mr. Muntz has, in the most handsome
manner, offered to shave off his beard and whiskers. This is true
magnanimity&mdash;Muntz is a noble fellow! and the lasting
gratitude of the House is due to him and his <em>hairs</em> for
ever.</p>
<hr />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>[pg
130]</span>
<h3>FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.</h3>
<p>It is expected that Mr. Snooks and family will pass the winter
at Battersea, as the warmth of the climate is strongly recommended
for the restoration of the health of Mrs. Snooks, who is in a state
of such alarming delicacy, as almost to threaten a realisation of
the fears of her best friends and the hopes of the black-job master
who usually serves the family.</p>
<p>Mr. Snivins gave a large tea-party, last week, at Greenwich,
where the boiling water was supplied by the people of the house,
the essentials having been brought by the visitors.</p>
<p>Mr. Popkins has left his attic in the New-Cut, for a
<em>tour</em> on the Brixton tread-mill.</p>
<p>K 32 left his official residence at the station-house, for his
beat in Leicester-square, and repaired at once to a public-house in
the neighbourhood, where he had an audience of several
pickpockets.</p>
<p>We are authorised to state, that there is no foundation whatever
for the report that a certain well-known policeman is about to lead
to the altar a certain unknown lady. The rumour originated in his
having been seen leading her before the magistrate.</p>
<p>Dick Wiggins transacted business yesterday in Cold Bath-fields,
and picked the appointed quantity of oakum.</p>
<p>Mr. Baron Nathan has left Margate for Kennington. We have not
heard whether he was accompanied by the Baroness. The Honourable
Miss Nathan, when we last heard of her, was dancing a hornpipe
among a shilling&rsquo;s worth of new laid eggs, at Tivoli.</p>
<p>A few minutes after Sir Robert Peel left Privy-Gardens, in a
carriage and four, for Claremont, Sam Snoxell jumped up behind the
Brighton stage, from which he descended, after having been whipped
down, at Kennington.</p>
<hr />
<h3>IMPORTANT INVENTION.</h3>
<p>The celebrated <em>savant</em> Sir Peter Laurie, whose
scientific labours to discover the cause of the variation of the
weathercock on Bow Church, have astonished the Lord Mayor and the
Board of Aldermen, has lately turned his attention to the subject
of railroads. The result of his profound cogitations has been
highly satisfactory. He has produced a plan for a railway on an
entirely new principle, which will combine cheapness and security
in an extraordinary degree. We have been favoured with a view of
the inventor&rsquo;s plans, and we have no hesitation in saying
that, if adopted, the most timid person may, with perfect safety,

<h3>THE FASTING PHENOMENON.</h3>
<p>The Tories have engaged Bernard Cavanagh, the Irish fasting
phenomenon, to give lectures on his system of abstinence, which
they think might be beneficially introduced amongst the
working-classes of England. This is a truly Christian principle of
government, for while the people <em>fast</em>, the ministers will
not fail to <em>prey</em>.</p>

<h3>RECREATION FOR THE PUBLIC.</h3>
<p>Sir Robert Peel seems impressed with the necessity of providing
the citizens of London with additional parks, where they may
recreate themselves, and breathe the free air of heaven. But,
strange as it may seem, the people cannot live on fresh air,
unaccompanied by some stomachic of a more substantial nature; yet
they are forbidden to grumble at the diet, or, if they do, they are
silenced according to the good old Tory plan of</p>

<h3>THE LIGHT OF ALL NATIONS.</h3>
<p>The public are aware that this important national undertaking,
which is now about to be commenced, is to be a prodigious cast-iron
light-house on the Goodwin Sands. Peter Borthwick and our Sibby are
already candidates for the office of universal illuminators. Peter
rests his claims chiefly on the brilliancy of his ideas, as
exemplified in his plan for lighting the metropolis with bottled
moonshine; while Sib. proudly refers to our columns for
imperishable evidences of the intensity of his wit, conscious that
these alone would entitle him to be called &ldquo;the light of all
nations.&rdquo; We trust that Sir Robert Peel will exercise a sound
discretion in bestowing this important situation. Highly as we
esteem Peter&rsquo;s dazzling talents&mdash;profoundly as we admire
his bottled moonshine scheme&mdash;we feel there is no man in the
world more worthy of being elevated to the lantern than our

<h2>A SHORT TREATISE OF DRAMATIC CASUALTIES.</h2>
<h3>VERY PROFITABLE TO READ.</h3>
<p>Let our Treatise of Dramatic Casualties be that which treateth
of the misfortunes contingent upon the profession of dramatic
authors. Now, of unfortunate dramatic authors there be two grand
kinds&mdash;namely, they that be unfortunate before the production
of their works, and they that be unfortunate after the production
of their works.</p>
<p>And first, among them that be unfortunate before the production
of their works may he enumerated&mdash;</p>
<ol style="list-style-position: inside;">
<li>&mdash;He that, having but one manuscript of his piece leaveth
the same with the manager for inspection, and it falleth out that
he seeth it no more, neither heareth thereof.</li>
<li>&mdash;He that having translated a piece from the French, and
bestowed thereon much time, findeth himself forestalled.</li>
<li>&mdash;He that, having written a pantomime, carrieth it in his
pocket, and straight there cometh a dishonest person, who, taking
the same, selleth it for waste paper.</li>
<li>&mdash;He that presenteth his piece to all the theatres in
succession, and lo! it ever returneth, accompanied with a polite
note expressive of disapprobation or the like.</li>
<li>&mdash;He whose piece is approved by the manager, but,
nevertheless, the same produceth it not, for divers reasons, which
do vary at every interview.</li>
<li>&mdash;He that communicateth the idea of a yet unwritten drama
to a friend, who, being of a fair wit, and prompt withal, useth the
same to his own ends and reapeth the harvest thereof.</li>
</ol>
<p>And secondly, of them that be unfortunate after the production
of their works, there be some whose pieces are successful, and
there be some whose pieces are not successful.</p>
<p>And firstly, of unfortunate authors whose pieces are
unsuccessful there be&mdash;</p>
<ol style="list-style-position: inside;">
<li>&mdash;Those who write a piece which faileth through its own
demerits, which may be, as&mdash;
<ol type="A">
<li>&mdash;He that writeth a farce or comedy, and neglecteth to
introduce jokes in the same.</li>
<li>&mdash;He that writeth a farce or comedy, and introduceth bad
jokes in the same.</li>
<li>&mdash;He that writeth a farce or comedy, and introduceth old
jokes in the same.</li>
<li>&mdash;He that writeth a tragedy, and introduceth matter for
merriment therein.</li>
<li>&mdash;He that, in either tragedy, comedy, farce, or other
entertainment, shocketh the propriety of the audience, or causeth a
division in the same, by political allusions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>&mdash;He that writeth a piece which faileth, though not
through its own demerits, which may be, as&mdash;
<ol type="A">
<li>&mdash;When the principal actor, not having the author&rsquo;s
words by heart, and being of a suggestive wit and good assurance,
substituteth others, which he deemeth sufficient.</li>
<li>&mdash;When the principal actor, not having the author&rsquo;s
words by heart, and being of a dull and heavy turn, and deaf
withal, substituteth nothing, but standeth aghast, yearning for the
voice of the prompter.</li>
<li>&mdash;When the scene-shifter ingeniously introduceth a forest
into a bed-chamber, or committeth the like incongruity, marvellous
pleasant and mirthful to behold, but in no way conducive to
success.</li>
<li>&mdash;When pistols or other fire-arms do miss fire; when red
fire igniteth not, or igniteth the scenes; when a trap-door
refuseth to open, a rope to draw, and the like.</li>
<li>&mdash;When the author intrusteth his principal part to a new
actor, and it falleth out that the same doth grievously offend the
audience, who straight insist that he do quit the stage, whereby
the ruin of the piece is consummated.</li>
<li>&mdash;Likewise there be misfortunes that arise from the
audience; as, when at a momentous point of the plot there entereth
one heated with liquor, and causeth a disturbance, or a woman with
a huge bonnet becometh the subject of a discussion as to her right
to wear the same, and impede the view of them that be behind; also
when there cometh in a ruffian, or more, in a pea-coat, who having
been charged by an enemy to work the ruin of the piece,
endeavoureth to do the same, by dint of hisses or other unseemly
noises, all of which be highly pernicious.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Secondly, of those unfortunate authors who have been successful,
there be&mdash;</p>
<ol style="list-style-position: inside;">
<li>&mdash;He whose piece, albeit successful, is withdrawn to make
room for the Christmas pantomine, Easter piece, or other
entertainment equally cherished by the manager, who thereupon
groundeth a plea of non-payment.</li>
<li>&mdash;He who being a creditor of the manager, and the same
being unable to meet his obligations, by an ingenious contrivance
of the law becometh cleansed thereof, an operation which hath been
conceitedly termed &ldquo;whitewashing.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&mdash;He that writeth a piece with a friend, and the same
claimeth the entire authorship thereof and emolument
therefrom.</li>
</ol>
<p>And there be divers other calamities which we have neither space
nor time to enumerate, but which be all incentives to abstain from
dramatic writing.</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h2>
<h3>JACK KETCH; OR, A LEAF FROM TYBURN TREE.</h3>
<p>Modern legislation is chiefly remarkable for its oppressive
interference with the elegant amusements of the mob.
Bartholomew-fair is abolished; bull-baiting, cock-pits, and
duck-hunts are put down by act of Parliament; prize-fighting, by
the New Police&mdash;even those morally healthful exhibitions,
formerly afforded opposite the Debtors&rsquo; Door of Newgate, for
the sake of <em>example</em>&mdash;that were attended by idlers in
hundreds, and thieves in thousands&mdash;are fast growing into
disuse. The &ldquo;masses&rdquo; see no pleasure now: even the
hanging-matches are cut off.</p>
<p>Deeply compassionating the effects of so illiberal an
innovation, Mr. G. Almar the author to, and Mr. R. Honner the
proprietor of, Sadler&rsquo;s Wells Theatre, have produced an
exhibition which in a great degree makes up for the infrequent
performances at the Old Bailey. Those whose moral sensibilities are
refined to the choking point&mdash;who can relish stage
strangulation in all its interesting varieties better than
Shakspere, are now provided with a rich treat. They need not wait
for the Recorder&rsquo;s black cap and a black Monday
morning&mdash;the Sadler&rsquo;s Wells&rsquo; people hang every
night with great success; for, unless one goes early, there
is&mdash;as is the case wherever hanging takes place&mdash;no
<em>standing room</em> to be had for love or money.</p>
<p>The play is simply the history of Jack Ketch, a gentleman who
flourished at the beginning of the last century, and who, by
industry and perseverance, attained to the rank of public
executioner; an office he performed with such skill and effect that
his successors have, as the bills inform us, inherited &ldquo;his
soubriquet&rdquo; with his office. He is introduced to the audience
as a ropemaker&rsquo;s apprentice, living in the immediate
neighbourhood of Execution-Dock, and loving <em>Barbara Allen</em>,
&ldquo;a young spinster residing at the Cottage of Content, upon
the borders of Epping Forest, supporting herself by the produce of
her wheel and the cultivation of her flower-garden.&rdquo; He
beguiles his time, while twisting the hemp, by spinning a tedious
yarn about this well-to-do spinster; from which we infer
<em>Barbara&rsquo;s</em> barbarity, and that he is crossed in love.
The soliloquy is interrupted by an elderly man, who enters to
remark that he has come out for a little relaxation after a hard
morning&rsquo;s work: no wonder, for we soon learn that he is the
<em>Jack Ketch</em> of his day, and has, but an hour before, tucked
up two brace of pirates. With this pleasing information, and a
sharp dialogue on his favourite subject with the hero, he
retires.</p>
<p>Here the interest begins; three or four foot-stamps are heard
behind; <em>Jack</em> starts&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, that noise,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&mdash;and on comes the author of the piece, &ldquo;his
first appearance here these five years.&rdquo; He approaches the
foot-lights&mdash;he turns up his eyes&mdash;he thumps his
breast&mdash;and goes through this exercise three or four times,
before the audience understand that they are to applaud. They do
so; and the play goes on as if nothing had happened; for this is an
episode expressive of a &ldquo;first appearance these five
years.&rdquo; <em>Gipsy George</em> or Mr. G. Almar, whichever you
please, having assured <em>Jack Ketch</em> that he is starving and
in utter destitution, proceeds to give five shillings for a piece
of rope, and walks away, after taking great pains to assure
everybody that he is going to hang himself. Before, however, he has
had time to make the first coil of a hempen collar, <em>Jack</em>
looks off, and descries the stranger in the last agonies of
strangulation, amidst the most deafening applause from the
audience, whose disgust is indignantly expressed by silence when he
exits to cut the man down. Their delight is only revived by the
apparition of <em>Gipsy George</em>, pale and ghastly, <em>with the
rope round his neck</em>, and the exclamation that he is
&ldquo;done for.&rdquo; <em>Barabbas</em>, the hangman, who
re-appears with the rest, is upbraided by <em>Jack</em> for coolly
looking on and letting the man hang himself, without raising an
alarm. Mr. B. answers, that &ldquo;it was no business of
his.&rdquo; Like Sir Robert Peel and the rest of the profession, it
was evidently his maxim not to interfere, unless &ldquo;regularly
called in.&rdquo; The <em>Gipsy</em>, so far from dying, recovers
sufficiently to make to <em>Jack</em> some important disclosures;
but of that mysterious kind peculiar to melodrama, by which nobody
is the wiser. They, however, bear reference to
<em>Jack&rsquo;s</em> deceased father, a clasp-knife, a certain
<em>Sir Gregory</em> of &ldquo;the gash,&rdquo; and the four
gentlemen so recently suspended at Execution-Dock.</p>
<p>The residence of Content and Barbara Allen is a scene, the
minute correctness of which it would be wicked to doubt, when the
bills so solemnly guarantee that it is copied from the &ldquo;best
authorities.&rdquo; <em>Barbara</em> opens the door, makes a
curtsey, produces a purse, and after saying she is going to pay her
rent, is, by an ingenious contrivance of the Sadler&rsquo;s
Wells&rsquo; Shakspere, confronted with her landlord, the <em>Sir
Gregory</em> before-mentioned. All stage-landlords are villains,
who prefer seduction to rent, and he of the &ldquo;gash&rdquo; is
no exception. The struggle, rescue, and duel, which follow, are got
through in no time. The last would certainly have been fatal, had
not the assailant&rsquo;s servant come on to announce that &ldquo;a
gentleman wished to speak to him at his own residence.&rdquo; The
lover (who is of course the rescuer) deems this a sufficient excuse
to let off his antagonist without a scratch; <em>Barbara</em>
rewards him with an embrace and a rose, just as another rival
intrudes himself in the person of <em>Mr. John Ketch</em>. The
altercation which now ensues is but slight; for <em>Jack</em>,
instead of fighting, goes off to Fairlop-fair with another young
lady, who seems to come upon the stage for no other purpose than to
oblige him. At the fair we find <em>Jack&rsquo;s</em> spirits
considerably damped by the prediction of a gipsy, that he will
marry a hangman&rsquo;s daughter; but, after the jumping in sacks,
which forms a part of the sports, he rescues <em>Barbara</em> from
being once more assailed by her landlord. Thereupon another
component of the festive scene&mdash;our friend the
hangman&mdash;declares that she is his daughter!
&ldquo;Horror&rdquo; tableau, and end of Act I.</p>
<p>After establishing a lapse of four years between the acts, the
author takes <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name=
"page132"></a>[pg 132]</span>high ground;&mdash;we are presented
with the summit of Primrose-hill, St. Paul&rsquo;s in the distance,
and a gentleman with black clothes, and literary habits, reading in
the foreground. This turns out to be &ldquo;The Laird
Lawson,&rdquo; <em>Barbara&rsquo;s</em> favoured lover and
benevolent duellist. Though on the top of Cockney Mount, he is
suffering under a deep depression of spirits; for he has never seen
<em>Miss Allen</em> during four years, come next Fairlop-fair.
Having heard this, the audience is, of course, quite prepared for
that lady&rsquo;s appearance; and, sure enough, on she comes,
accounting for her presence with great adroitness:&mdash;having
left the city to go to Holloway, she is taking a short cut over
Primrose-hill. The lovers go through the mode of recognition never
departed from at minor theatres, with the most frantic energy, and
have nearly hugged themselves out of breath, when the executioner
papa interrupts the blissful scene, without so much as saying how
he got there; but &ldquo;finishers&rdquo; are mysterious beings.
<em>Barabbas</em> denounces the laird; and when his consent is
asked for the hand of <em>Miss Barbara</em>, tells the lover
&ldquo;he will see him hanged first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moon, a dark stage, and <em>Jack Ketch</em> in the character
of a foot-pad, now add to the romance of the drama. Not to leave
anything unexplained, the hero declares, that he has cut the walk
of life he formerly trod in the rope ditto, and has been induced to
take to the road solely by Fate, brandy and (not salt, but)
<em>Barbara!</em> By some extraordinary accident, every character
in the piece, with two exceptions, have occasion to tread this
scene&mdash;&ldquo;Holloway and heath near the village of
Holloway&rdquo; (painted from the best authorities), just exactly
in time to be robbed by <em>Ketch</em>; who shows himself a perfect
master of his business, and a credit to his instructor; for
<em>Gipsy George</em> rewards <em>Jack</em> for saving him from
hanging, by showing his friend the shortest way to the gallows.</p>
<p>In the following scene, the plot breaks out in a fresh place.
The man with the &ldquo;gash,&rdquo; and <em>Gipsy George</em> are
together, going over some youthful reminiscences. It seems that
once upon a time there were six pirates; four were those pendents
from the gibbet at Execution-Dock one hears so much about at the
commencement; the fifth is the speaker, <em>Gipsy George</em>; and
&ldquo;you,&rdquo; exclaims that person, striking an attitude, and
addressing <em>Sir Gregory</em>, &ldquo;make up the
half-dozen!&rdquo; They all formerly did business in a ship called
the &ldquo;Morning Star,&rdquo; and whenever the ex-pirate number
five is in pecuniary distress, he bawls out into the ear of
<em>ci-devant</em> pirate number six, the words &ldquo;Morning
Star!&rdquo; and a purse of hush-money is forked out in a trice. In
this manner <em>Gipsy George</em> accumulates, by the end of the
piece, a large property; for six or eight purses, all ready filled
for each occasion, thus pass into his pockets.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;best authorities&rdquo; furnish us, next, with an
interior; that of &ldquo;the Mug, a chocolate house and
tavern,&rdquo; where a new plot is hatched against the crown and
dignity of the late respected George the First, by a party of
Jacobites. These consist of a half-dozen of Hanoverian Whigs, who
enter, duly decorated with an equal number of hats of every variety
of cock and cockade. The heroine seems to have engaged herself here
as waitress, on purpose to meet her persecutor, <em>Sir
Gregory</em>, and her late lover, <em>Jack Ketch</em>. What comes
of this rencontre it is impossible to make out, for a general
<em>m&eacute;l&eacute;e</em> ensues, caused by a discovery of the
plot; which is by no means a gunpowder plot; for although a file of
soldiers present their arms for several minutes full at the
conspirators, not a single musket goes off. Perhaps gunpowder was
expensive in the reign of George the First. <em>Jack Ketch</em>
ends the act with a dream&mdash;an <em>apropos finale</em>, for we
caught several of our neighbours napping. The scene in which this
vision takes place is the crowning result of the painter&rsquo;s
researches amongst the &ldquo;best authorities;&rdquo; it being no
less than &ldquo;a garret in Grub-street, <em>in which the great
Daniel De Foe composed his romance of Robinson
Crusoe!!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fishing-party&mdash;whose dulness is relieved by a
suicide&mdash;opens the last act: one of the anglers having
finished a comic song&mdash;which from its extreme gravity forms an
appropriate dirge to the forthcoming felo-de-se&mdash;goes off with
his companion to leave the water clear for <em>Barbara Allen</em>,
who enters, takes an affecting leave of her laird lover, and
straightway drowns herself. <em>Jack Ketch</em> is now, by a rapid
change of scene, discovered in limbo, and condemned to death; why,
we were too stupid to make out. The fatal cart&mdash;very likely
modelled after &ldquo;the best authorities&rdquo;&mdash;next
occupies the stage, drawn by a real horse, and filled with <em>Sir
Gregory Gash</em> (who it seems is going to be hanged) and <em>Jack
Ketch</em> not as a prisoner, but as an officer of the crown; for
we are to suppose that <em>Mr. Barabbas</em>, having retired from
the public scaffold to private life, has seceded in favour of
<em>Jack Ketch</em>, who is saved from the rope himself, on
condition of his using it upon the person of <em>Sir Gregory</em>
and every succeeding criminal. All the characters come on with the
cart, and a <em>d&eacute;nouement</em> evidently impends. The
distracted lover demands of somebody to restore his mistress, which
<em>Gipsy George</em> is really so polite as to do; for although
the bills expressly inform us she has committed
&ldquo;suicide,&rdquo; and we have actually seen her jump into the
river Lea; yet there she is safe and sound!&mdash;carefully
preserved in an envelope formed partly by the <em>Gipsy</em>
himself, and partly by his cloak. She, of course, embraces her
lover, and leaves <em>Jack Ketch</em> to embrace his profession
with what appetite he may; all, in fact, ends happily, and <em>Sir
Gregory</em> goes off to be hanged.</p>
<p>This, then, is the state to which the founders of the Newgate
school of dramatic literature, and the march of intellect, have
brought us. Nothing short of actual hanging&mdash;the most
revolting and repulsive of all possible subjects to enter, much
less to dwell in any mind not actually savage&mdash;must now be
provided to meet the refined taste of play-goers. In the present
instance, nothing but the actual <em>spiciness</em> of the subject
saved the piece from the last sentence of even Sadler&rsquo;s
Wells&rsquo; critical law; for in construction and detail, it is
the veriest mass of incoherent rubbish that was ever shot upon the
plains of common sense. The sketch we have made is in no one
instance exaggerated. Our readers may therefore easily judge
whether we speak truly or not.</p>
<hr class="full" />
<h2>PUNCH AT THE NEW STRAND.</h2>
<p>When Napoleon first appeared before the grand army after his
return from Elba&mdash;when Queen Victoria made her
<em>d&eacute;b&ucirc;t</em> at the assemblage of her first
parliament&mdash;when Kean performed &ldquo;Othello&rdquo; at Drury
Lane immediately after he had caused a certain friend of his to
play the same part in the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench&mdash;the
public mind was terribly agitated, and the public&rsquo;s legs
instinctively carried them, on each occasion, to behold those great
performers. When&mdash;to give these circumstances their highest
application,&mdash;&ldquo;Punch,&rdquo; on Thursday last, came out
in the regular drama, the excitement was no less intense. Boxes
were besieged; the pit was choked up, and the gallery creaked with
its celestial encumbrance.</p>
<p>As the curtain drew up, there would have been a death-like
silence but for the unparalleled sales that were taking place in
apples, oranges, and ginger-beer. Expectation was on tip-toe, as
were the persons occupying that department of the theatre called
&ldquo;standing-room.&rdquo; The looked-for moment came; the
&ldquo;drop&rdquo; ascended, and the spectators beheld <em>Mr.
Dionysius Swivel</em>, a pint of ale, and Punch&rsquo;s
theatre!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tragedy,&rdquo; saith the Aristotelian recipe for cooking
up a serious drama, &ldquo;should have the probable, the
marvellous, and the pathetic.&rdquo; In the <em>tableau</em> thus
presented, the audience beheld the three conditions strictly
complied with all at once. &ldquo;It was highly probable,&rdquo; as
<em>Mr. Swivel</em> observed to the source of pipes, &rsquo;bacca,
and malt&mdash;in other words, to the landlady he was
addressing&mdash;that his master, the showman, was unable to pay
the score he had run up; it was marvellous that the proprietor of
so popular a puppet as &ldquo;Punch&rdquo; should not have even the
price of a pint of ale in his treasury; lastly, that circumstance
was deeply pathetic; for what so heart-rending as the exhibition of
fallen greatness, of broken-down prosperity, of affluence regularly
stumped and hard-up! The fact is, that &ldquo;Punch,&rdquo; his
theatre, and <em>corps dramatique</em>, are in pawn for
eight-and-ninepence!</p>
<p>In the midst of this distress there appears a young gentleman,
giving vent to passionate exclamations, while furiously buttoning
up a tight surtout. The object of his love is the daughter of the
object of his hate. <em>Mr. Snozzle</em>, having previously made
his bow, overhears him, and being the acting manager of
&ldquo;Punch,&rdquo; and having a variety of plots for rescuing
injured lovers from inextricable difficulties on hand, offers one
of them to the lover, considerably over cost price; namely, for the
puppet-detaining eight-and-ninepence, and a glass of
brandy-and-water. The bargain being struck, the scene changes.</p>
<p>To the happiness of being the possessor of &ldquo;Punch,&rdquo;
<em>Mr. Snozzle</em> adds that of having a wonderful wife&mdash;a
lady of universal talents; who dances in spangled shoes, plays on
the tamburine, and sings Whitechapel French like a native. This
inestimable creature has already gone round the town on a singing,
dancing, and cash-collecting expedition; accompanied by the drum,
mouth-organ, and <em>Swivel</em>. We now find her enchanting the
flinty-hearted father, <em>Old Fellum</em>. Having been
instrumental, by means of her vocal abilities, in drawing from him
a declaration of amorous attachment and half-a-crown, she retires,
to bury herself in the arms of her husband, and to eradicate the
score, recorded in chalk, at <em>Mrs. Rummer&rsquo;s</em>
hotel.</p>
<p>In the meantime <em>Snozzle</em>, having sold a plot, proceeds
to fulfil the bargain by executing it. He enters with PUNCH&rsquo;S
theatre, to treat <em>Old Fellum</em> with a second exhibition, and
his daughter with an elopement; for in the midst of the performance
the young lady detects the big drum in the act of &ldquo;winking at
her;&rdquo; and she soon discovers that PUNCH&rsquo;S orchestra is
no other than her own lover. <em>Fellum</em> is delighted with the
show, to which he is attentive enough to allow of the lovers&rsquo;
escaping. He pursues them when it is too late, and having been so
precipitate in his exit as to remember to forget to pay for his
amusement, <em>Swivel</em> steals a handsome cage, parrot
included.</p>
<p>Good gracious! what a scene of confusion and confabulation next
takes place! <em>Fellum&rsquo;s</em> first stage in pursuit is the
public-house; there he unwittingly persuades <em>Mrs. Snozzle</em>
that her spouse is unfaithful&mdash;that <em>he</em> it was who
&ldquo;stole away the old man&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; <em>Mrs.
Snozzle</em> raves, and threatens a divorce; <em>Snozzle</em>
himself trembles&mdash;he suspects the police are after him for
being the receiver of stolen goods, instead of the deceiver of
unsuspecting virtue. <em>Swivel</em> dreads being taken up for
prigging the parrot; and a frightful catastrophe is only averted by
the entrance of the truant lovers, who have performed the comedy of
&ldquo;Matrimony&rdquo; in a much shorter time than is allowed by
the act of Parliament.</p>
<p>Mrs. Keeley played the tamburine, and the part of <em>Snozzle
femme</em>. This was more than acting; it was nature enriched with
humour&mdash;character broadly painted without a tinge of
caricature. The solemnity of her countenance, while performing with
her feet, was a correct copy from the expression of
self-approbation&mdash;of the
wonder-how-I-do-it-so-well&mdash;always observable during the
dances of the <em>fair</em> sex; her tones when singing were
unerringly brought from the street; her spangled dress was
assuredly borrowed from Scowton&rsquo;s caravan. As a work of
dramatic art, this performance is, of its kind, most complete.
Keeley&rsquo;s <em>Snozzle</em> was quiet, rich, and philosophical;
and Saunders made a Judy of himself with unparalleled success.
<em>Frank Finch</em> got his deserts in the hands of a Mr. Everett;
for being a lover, no matter how awkward and ungainly an actor is
made to represent him.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
